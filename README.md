c# Crowdfunding SQL

## Learning Goals

* Identify table example  
* Create a new table, records, and queries

## Identify Table Example

`SQL` is a programming language that allows you to "nest" statements inside each
other. Let's quickly consider an example using grocery data.

### Create a Grocery Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);

INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Apples", 2, 1);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Oranges", 4, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(3, "Peaches", 6, 3);
```

### Selecting Data from the Grocery Table

Given the example SQL above, we'd be able to run a query like

```sql
SELECT * FROM groceries;
```

And get back the inserted data (represented in a table below)

```text
id                 name        quantity      aisle
------------    ----------  ----------  ----------  
1                Apples          2          1
2                Oranges         4          2
3                Peaches         6          3
```

### `SUM`

`SUM` will return the total of the column you select. In this case, the total
number of items in the `groceries` column is 12.

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries;
```

### Returns

```sql
SUM(quantity)
-------------
12
```

To make it a little more useful we can `GROUP BY` the aisle that the items are
in and `ORDER BY` the sum of the `aisle`.

```sql
SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle ORDER BY SUM(quantity);
```

### Returns

```sql
aisle    SUM(quantity)
-------  --------------
1           2
2           4
3           6
```

## Instructions

In this lab, you have two tasks - first, you will need to create three tables in
`lib/create.sql`, and populate them with data in `lib/insert.sql`. Then, you
will need to write the necessary SQL statements inside the methods in
`lib/sql_queries.rb` that would allow you to query data from your newly created
tables.

## Create New Table, Records and Queries

Now we're going to create a schema based on the following information:

* A project has a title, a category, a funding goal, a start date, and an end date.
* A user has a name and an age
* A pledge has an amount. It belongs to a user, and it also belongs to a project.

### Create the Tables

In the `create.sql` file, model your tables. You should have a table for
projects, users, and pledges.

### Insert Records into Database

Within the `insert.sql` file, insert 10 projects, 20 users, and 30 pledges into the database.

### Write the Queries

Write SQL queries as strings in `lib/sql_queries` in each of the provided methods.

Run `learn` as you go and read the test messages for additional guidance.
